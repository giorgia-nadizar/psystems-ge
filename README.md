# P Systems inference via Grammatical Evolution

## Abstract
P systems are a bio-inspired framework for defining parallel models of computation. Despite their relevance for both theoretical and application scenarios, the design and synthesis of P systems remain a tedious and demanding task. In this work, we try to address this problem by proposing an automated design methodology based on Grammatical Evolution (GE)â€”an evolutionary computation technique. We consider a situation where observations of the steps of a P system are available, and we rely on GE for automatically inferring its structure, i.e., its rules.

## Code
- P systems code based on [Psystem-GA](https://github.com/gpietrop/Psystem-GA).
- Grammatical evolution code based on [PonyGE](https://github.com/PonyGE/PonyGE2).
