# P Systems inference via Grammatical Evolution

## Abstract
P systems are a bio-inspired framework for defining parallel models of computation. Despite their relevance for both theoretical and application scenarios, the design and synthesis of P systems remain a tedious and demanding task. In this work, we try to address this problem by proposing an automated design methodology based on Grammatical Evolution (GE)â€”an evolutionary computation technique. We consider a situation where observations of the steps of a P system are available, and we rely on GE for automatically inferring its structure, i.e., its rules.

## Code
- P systems code based on [Psystem-GA](https://github.com/gpietrop/Psystem-GA).
- Grammatical evolution code based on [PonyGE](https://github.com/PonyGE/PonyGE2).

### Install
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run an experiment
```
cd src
python psystems_experiments.py --parameters psystems.txt
```
This will automatically create a sequence of membrane configurations and a suitable grammar for evolving the ruleset.
The file psystems.txt (located in the parameters folder) can be customized to edit parameters, e.g., alter number of generations or population size.
The default values for ruleset size, rule type, and dataset generation seed, are 10, send_in, and 0, respectively.
It is possible to pass additional parameters to the script to change them, as for example:

```
cd src
python psystems_experiments.py --parameters psystems.txt --random_seed 1 --ruleset_size 15 --rule_type send_out --dataset_seed 1
```

### Outcomes
Each experiment generates some files:
- the grammar used (all follow the same template, but differ in the objects and membranes) $\to$ grammars/psystems folder
- the training set $\to$ datasets/Psystems folder
- the results of the experiment $\to$ results/exp_name/machine_name_timestamp folder
  - stats.tsv reports the progress of evolution
  - parameters.txt summarized the employed parameters
  - best.txt reports the best individual
  - best_fitness.pdf displays the evolution of the fitness of the best individual

## Other files
The core lies in the src/fitness/psystems/IdentificationProblem.py where we define the parsing of rules from the grammar generated strings and the distance between membranes (i.e., the fitness function).
